What are the risks involved in building such a pipeline?
Ans- Since twitter api is an open source api, we should constantly monitor it for any deprecations that might lead to problems in our runs. 
Scraping the data from outside network requires a proper security network which should be enabled to avoid any security leaks or penetrations. The data should also be sanitized if needed.
Load should be monitored continuosly to check the cluster.

How would you roll out the pipeline going from proof-of-concept to a production-ready solution?
Ans- 

What would a production-ready solution entail that a POC wouldn't?
Ans- There would be quite a few things that a production-ready solution will entail that a POC wouldn't like-
The security aspect would be a big factor so that no company data or access is compromised.
There would be other security features added for PR pul, code merge etc.
The production ready solution will entail autoscale cluster with higher configurations to deal with the massive data processing.
An advanced monitoring layer would be added on top to keep everything in control and monitor the changes that might affect the processing.
An AI landscape based UI would be provided to take a look at the output and filter them based on the columns or other factors.

What is the level of effort required to deliver each phase of the solution?

What is your estimated timeline for delivery for a production-ready solution?
